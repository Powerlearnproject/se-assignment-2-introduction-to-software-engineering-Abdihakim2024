# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:\
Software engineering is the process of developing, testing and deploying computer applications to solve real-world problems by adhering to a set of engineering principles and best practices. it applies methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software system.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
software engeneering involves sofware production designs,development, testing and mentenance.
The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Stage 1: Planning Stage
Stage 2: Feasibility or Requirements of Analysis Stage
Stage 3: Design and Prototyping Stage
Stage 4: Software Development Stage
Stage 5: Software Testing Stage
Stage 6: Implementation and Integration
Stage 7: Operations and Maintenance Stage


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
Waterfall principles
Waterfall is a classical SDLC methodology that follows logical progression of linear and sequential phases within the project lifecycle process. Some of the key principles in Waterfall include:
Sequential structure. Typically includes phases such as Requirements, Design, Implementation, Verification, and Maintenance.
Strong focus on documentation. Extensive details that define project requirements and implementation process.
Low customer involvement. Requirements must be agreed early during the project lifecycle. Once requirements are defined, the development process is strongly focused on meeting the agreed requirements.

Agile principles
The Agile SDLC model is designed to facilitate change and eliminate waste processes (similar to Lean). It replaces a command-and-control style of Waterfall development with an approach that prepares for and welcomes changes.

The key differentiating Agile principles include:
Individuals and interactions over process and tools. Build a strong communication and collaboration mindset between team members across all functional domains.
Working software instead of comprehensive documentation. Tactic knowledge is more valuable than document knowledge that’s often difficult to communicate and never truly sufficiently descriptive. Communications that take place while working together are likely to effectively communicate the necessary information between team members—as opposed to writing this information in a large documentation resource.
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. Requirements change rapidly, especially when projects take prolonged duration to build and deploy, whereas as the market dynamics changes unpredictably.
Responding to change over following a plan. A successful project development model that has the provision to adapt can help the vendor and customer meet collective goals without exceeding project scope.


What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
